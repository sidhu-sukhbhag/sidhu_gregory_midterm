    <h2>Hardware Compatibility

    <p>Mac: macOS is exclusive to Apple computers, meaning it’s only meant to run on devices like the MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini, and Mac Pro</p>
  
    <p>Windows: In contrast, Windows runs on a wide range of devices, from powerful workstations to smaller devices like the Raspberry Pi1. As of April 2022, 74% of computers worldwide run on Windows, compared to 15% for macOS1.</p>
  
    <h2>Customization

    </h2>
    <p>Mac: Apple manufactures its own hardware and software, which makes it simpler to select which computer you need1.</p>
    <p>Windows: Computers running on Windows have a greater degree of customization compared to Apple’s. You’re free to change a PC’s CPU, GPU, memory, and storage far easier than you can with an Apple device1.</p>
  
    <h2>Game Compatibility

    </h2>
    <p>Mac: Game compatibility, or lack of it, is the single most critical contributor to the downfall of Mac gaming</p>
    <p>Windows: Currently, there are thousands more games available for Windows than Mac, and none (to this writer’s knowledge) that are available for Mac only and not Windows.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion

    </h2>
    <p>Both operating systems have their strengths and weaknesses. It ultimately comes down to what’s most important to you. If you want an easy-to-use operating system, or one that provides greater flexibility, if security is a priority, or if interoperability with other systems is important, these are all factors to consider when choosing between Windows and macOS1.</p>

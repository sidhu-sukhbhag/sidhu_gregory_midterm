## Hardware Compatibility

**Mac**

_macOS is exclusive to Apple computers, meaning it’s only meant to run on devices like the MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini, and Mac Pro_

**Windows**

_In contrast, Windows runs on a wide range of devices, from powerful workstations to smaller devices like the Raspberry Pi1. As of April 2022, 74% of computers worldwide run on Windows, compared to 15% for macOS1._

## Customization**

**Mac**

_Apple manufactures its own hardware and software, which makes it simpler to select which computer you need1._

**Windows**

_Computers running on Windows have a greater degree of customization compared to Apple’s. You’re free to change a PC’s CPU, GPU, memory, and storage far easier than you can with an Apple device1._

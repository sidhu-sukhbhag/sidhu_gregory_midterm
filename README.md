**Hardware Compatibility**

Mac
_macOS is exclusive to Apple computers, meaning itâ€™s only meant to run on devices like the MacBook, iMac, Mac Mini, and Mac Pro_

Windows
_In contrast, Windows runs on a wide range of devices, from powerful workstations to smaller devices like the Raspberry Pi1. As of April 2022, 74% of computers worldwide run on Windows, compared to 15% for macOS1._
